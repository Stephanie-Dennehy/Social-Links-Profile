## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://stephanie-dennehy.github.io/Social-Links-Profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had some trouble getting the block around the social links and the text to both change together on hover. I was able to search (and find) some solutions online that worked. I enjoyed trying to find different solutions on my own before looking for help. But I'm also glad that my search skills and reading solutions/documentation are improving so that I can find what works! 

### Continued development

I want to continue building my design and coding skills as I complete these challeneges. My goal is to focus on both desktop and mobile designs so I can make sites responsive and look good in any format.
